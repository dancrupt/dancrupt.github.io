I often look at people and wonder what they're thinking. Why they do what they do. Do they even process the consequences of their actions before they take them? It certainly doesn't seem like they do. Most people seem to be living someone else's version of their life. It's so damn disingenuous. So wasteful.

When I think about how the average human spends their time, it makes me fucking sad. It should make you sad too. We have this amazing gift. Life went through thousands of years of evolution and improvement to make the nearly perfect versions of us. The fact that humanity has made it this far is a true testament to its survivability. We want to be alive. We *need* to be alive.

And yet, most of us don't appreciate it. Excluding the many unfortunate people in the world, most people take the fact that we're walking, talking, alive and well for granted. People complain and fight about the stupidest things. The most trivial shit causes them to hurt each other. Why the fuck are we doing this to ourselves?

If you were born or live in the developed world, you're one of the luckiest people to have ever lived. Even those born in crime ridden American ghettos have it better than most on this lonely, suspended-in-the-middle-of-nothing planet of ours. Think about it.

You could've been born in a North Korean prison camp. Or a slum in Mumbai. Or a Bolivian mining town where people work their entire lives buried deep in the mountains, only to end up there again when it's all over. But you were born, or atleast raised in the West.

I'm certainly not implying that things are perfect here. They're not. People don't have jobs, the cost of living is high, and certain luxuries are expensive. But do you really need them? If you do, they're certainly achievable. It's not like you work hard to earn some bread, only to have it stolen from you. It's not like you have to go to the police station to complain about your stolen bread, only to have them turn you away, or worse.

There are places on this planet, where people die going to, or coming home from work. Their lives are lost in the mundane struggle of mere survival. Their lives are lost in the process of earning enough to pay rent, just so they could come home, have small portions of food, and worry about their family's future. They don't even think about their own self. These people are ultimately the ones who deserve the luxuries of the West. They're the ones who deserve job security, respect and love. True, genuine, moving love. Love that would break you, if it walked away from you. 

If I'm ever granted a thousand wishes, I'd ask for these people's lives to be eased. For their financial, emotional, physical and social struggles to end. For them to be able to experience the true joys of life. The true, romantic love of a human being. The joys of listening to beautiful, heart-melting music. The companionship of an adorable puppy. The sweetness of well-made chocolate. The tranquility of an altered, relaxed state of mind.

There's so much profound beauty around us. Everywhere. It just sucks that most people don't get to experience it.
